# Signature Work Portfolio Reflection

As a Computer Science major with a minor in Data Science, I’ve used GitHub as a platform to document and reflect on meaningful projects beyond coursework. This Signature Work portfolio highlights three public projects that reflect my growth across creative programming, community service, and software development. Two projects were built outside of this class, and one which was "Piano-Visual-Playground" was my final for creative coding. Each includes its own `README.md` file.

## Piano Visual Playground  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AB12900/Piano-Visual-Playground)

**Domain Focus: Real-Time Audio-Visual Interaction**

This browser-based creative coding project was built with p5.js, p5.sound, and Tweakpane. It transforms music and piano key input into responsive visuals, offering an engaging way to explore sound-to-visual mappings.

**Key Features:**
- Keyboard-driven piano with sound-reactive visuals
- 4 unique visual modes: Flow Field, Liquid Drip, Harmonic Sands, Waveform Terrain
- preloaded MP3 music input
- Tweakpane controls for playback, visuals, and volume

This project helped me develop real-time input systems and creative data mapping. I deepened my understanding of amplitude analysis and how to represent musical intensity through generative visuals.

## Daryeel Website Demo  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AB12900/Daryeel-Website-Demo)  
[Live Demo](https://ab12900.github.io/Daryeel-Website-Demo/)

**Community Outreach Through Web Design**

Built as part of a volunteer project for Daryeel Youth, this site presents mission information, volunteer details, and a clean user interface for community engagement.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly navigation
- Sections for About, Services, and Join Us
- Interactive scroll-based highlights and mobile menu toggle

Although this site uses HTML, CSS, and JS, its primary function is non-technical: communication and outreach. It shows how tech skills can promote civic engagement and serve community missions.

## Snake Game Project  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AB12900/SnakeGameProject)

**Domain Focus: Algorithmic Thinking and Game Mechanics**

This is a personal Python project recreating the classic Snake game using the `turtle` module. It focuses on modular OOP design and collision logic.

**Key Features:**
- Classes for Snake, Food, and Scoreboard
- Real-time movement and collision detection
- Keyboard input (arrow keys) for gameplay
- Score tracking and clean game over logic

This was my first project and it reinforced my understanding of state tracking, event loops, and class architecture. It also reflects how simple game development can improve coding fluency.

## Summary

Together, these three projects reflect:
- **Creative technology** in Piano Visual Playground
- **Civic engagement** through Daryeel Website
- **Foundational programming** in Snake Game

They represent how I’ve applied my CS knowledge in artistic, personal, and community contexts. GitHub is not just where the code lives it’s where reflection and growth are documented.
